Screen 2:

The Empress was at the edge of death. 
Yet, her spirit remains and she breathes; 
only immobilized by her darkly wound.

Screen 3:

“The Empress was superior in all her abilities.
No emperor could match her power and might.
Her wisdom was far above those even of the Senate.”
–Lord Emperor Varius of the Second Imperial Province

Screen 4:

The dark legions grow stronger.
Though they are being measly rationed;
there must be another battle, elsewhere.

Screen 5:

“The Republic became slow.
The Senate and lethargy became friends;
so that the people sought to slay them both.”
–Records of the Emprate

Screen 6:

The legions now seem to be guided;
no longer are they mere scouts.
There must be no other battle now.

Screen 7:

“The Senate was nearly unresponsive.
Action was not a word spoken;
Quick was never an attribute to be valued.”
–Records of the Emprate

Screen 8:

“The people became restless. 
They petitioned for change;
but the Senate did not hear.”
–Records of the Emprate

Screen 9:

The Empress’ spirit has strengthened.
Her body moves; but only sightly.

Screen 10: 

The castle walls roar; bits of brick have broken off.
But even so, the dark legions continue to grow.

Screen 11:

“Then, the princeps turned his ear;
He went to the people and heard all of their words;
and spoke great things to them.”
–Records of the Emprate

Screen 12:

The blasts of every battle 
have burned the castle’s systems.
There is no rebuilding now.

Screen 13:

“The people were in awe of the princeps;
they loved him like as a father.
All of the things he said they heard.”
–Records of the Emprate

Screen 14:

The Empress moves more freely.
Her eyes open; but only slightly.

Screen 15:

More strength do the dark legions acquire.
The legions from afar must now be arriving.

Screen 16:

“The people with great fervor moved;
and they made the princeps an emperor;
that he should rule over them and direct them.”
–Records of the Emprate

Screen 17:

The Empress freezes suddenly.
Her body unhealed from the darkly wound;
but she still breathes.

Screen 18:

“The Emperor–unrepentant–hated his new power.
He despised even the concept of what he had become.
This was not what he desired from the people.”
–Records of the Emprate

Screen 19:

“Thus, the Emperor decided to create a different system.
One that would appease the desire of the people.
Yet not let them be oppressed.”
–Records of the Emprate

Screen 20:

Commanders now join the dark legions.
Yet the castle somehow is withstanding.

Screen 21:

“That day was great.
The Emperor formed the Emprate.
He then laid down his power.
The people were greatly satisfied.”
–Records of the Emprate

Screen 22:

The Empress remains frozen;
but she speaks a word:
“The light… fades.”

Screen 23:

Her hands move again;
but again they are still weak.

Screen 24:

Something within it, is stirring;
the castle seems to be strengthened.

Screen 25:

The Empress raises swiftly.
“I’ve escaped!”
But a dark mist from her darkly wound
envelops her; it solidifies around her.
But you cannot help her; you cannot leave the wall.

Screen 26:

“Each emperor must rule fairly in his own province, 
	lest the citizens make petition to the Senate.”
–Statutes of the Emprate

Screen 27:

“A nominated heir cannot be a relation of the nominating emperor,
	nor can the heir have any connections with the other emperors.”
–Statutes of the Emprate

Screen 28:

You feel strange.
There is something beyond the legions.
Something darker.

Screen 29:

The dark mist continues to solidify the Empress.
She can barely breath now.
But you cannot help her; you cannot leave the wall.

Screen 30:

More specialized soldiers arrive with the legions.

Screen 31:

“The farlands contain great darkness.
Survivors say the night was living and stalking them.
One must be careful of this evil place.”
–Lord Emperor Marius of the Third Imperial Province

Screen 32:

“The people were satisfied with their new emperors.
Each in their own province, defined in the Emprate,
with the Senatorial province in their midst.”
–Records of the Emprate

Screen 33:

A strange feeling eclipses you; stronger this time.
You notice the night getting darker;
Darker than the twilight that it was.

Screen 34:

The Empress struggles to breath. 
She tries to move, but the black shell around her restricts.
You would help her; but you cannot leave the wall.

Screen 35:

You watch the coming legions.
Snipers are in their midst;
one must be weary of them.

Screen 36:

“Their emperors gave them order.
The absolute order that they craved.”
–Records of the Emprate

Screen 37:

“The Emprate has not seen a drip of blood 
spilled within its borders for centuries. 
Surely this testifies of its great construction.”
–Lord Emperor Cornelius of the First Imperial Province

Screen 38:

The night deepens;
yet it was already midnight.

Screen 39:

The Empress struggles to move once more;
her shell cracks slightly; but it constricts her chest.
Her breaths are very short now.
You would help her; but you cannot leave the wall.

Screen 40:

“Dark magic changes one. 
It transforms them into a different person. 
It changes ones desires to its desires.”
–Records of the Emprate

Screen 41:

“For all the greatness of the Emprate,
it yet lacked; unification between the emperors
was challenging; nonetheless the people were
not blind to this.”
–Princeps Cicero of the Senatorial Province

Screen 42:

“The people remembered the Master Emperor;
the great one who created their emprate.
Yet they thought of the reign of one man again.”

Screen 43:

“The idea grew; its roots stumbled upon forgotten lakes.
Deep lakes of zeal and passion.
‘A Supreme Emperor’ their hearts leaped.
That is what we desire!”

Screen 44:

“They looked; deeply they looked among
the emperors and their nominated heirs;
searching for what they desired.”

Screen 45:

“But no emperor or nominated heir even
matched their beloved Master Emperor.
Not one was glorious enough to direct them.”

Screen 46:

“Yet one day, an emperor made 
an uncommon nomination; a young woman
who was obscure and lowly.”

Screen 47:

“The young nominated heir was so pure,
innocent and very peaceful in her way.
Her tongue spoke no harshness, but only wisdom.
Every man could only admire her.”

Screen 48:

“The people wondered; their hearts inquired;
‘Could this be?’ 
‘Could this be the one?’
‘Have we found our ruler once and for all?’”

Screen 49:

“Her nominating emperor died in a battle on the frontier.
Thus, she was seated as the Empress; and as empress
she did many great things in her province so that
the people loved her and she was as like a mother.”

Screen 50:

“The people moved to make her—the Supremess; 
a supreme empress over them all. But the battles on
the frontier became greater. The other emperors
were in retreat and the Senate’s proconsuls defeated.
Thus, the Empress took her legions to fight.”

Screen 51:

And at last, you the last imperial legate of the empress,
you sense something incredibly dark and yet there are no legions left
for a dark force to be beyond.
~
The Empress continues to struggle; again the shell cracks further;
but constricts around her chest pushing her breath out of her.
The light in her eyes fades.
~
“Dark magic requires sacrifice. 
The death of the innocent fuels its power. 
Only the destruction of good makes it stronger.”
–Records of the Emprate
~
The night darkens further beyond what night is.
But you notice something approaches the wall.
