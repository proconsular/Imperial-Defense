//Outro

--

	The Dark Emperor has been defeated
    and you have single-handedly defeated all of his dark legions.
    With nothing to fight and with the wall needing no defense
    you rush into the castle and climb up to the Empress’ chamber.

==

--

    You find her incased in a partly cracked shell;
    you smash it with your weapon and pull her out.

==

--

    She lays limp in your arms
    but you take your hand that has been infused
    with all the power of the Dark Emperor and touch her face.
    You command the power to heal her
    and it evaporates into her.

==

--

	You wait.

==

--

	A moment passes.

==

--

	An hour passes.

==

--

	The light in her eyes brightens.

==

--

	She awakes fully and stands up.
    You knee quickly and pay homage.
	“You have saved me, my kind and great legate.
    Tell me, what has happened since my illness.”

==

--

	And you tell her of all the things that had happened.
    Of the great legions you destroyed and of the Dark Emperor that you slayed
    and took his power to save her from the clutches of death.

==

--

	“You have done such great and wonderful things!
    You are truly a great warrior and
    shalt be remembered for all time in the Emprate forever.

==

--

    May your name be sung in the songs of the Emprate
    because you have saved it and us from this great evil.
    What is your name, my great legate?”

    You tell her your name.

==

--

	“Marius, I nominate you as my heir!”
	You bow down all the way till you lay on the floor.
	“My Empress, I shalt not be so deserving to be nominated by you.
    For you, you must be named the Supremess!
    For you are far greater than all other emperors
    before you and before now.”

==

--

    “My great heir, please be patient.
    We must first restore and recover the Emprate.
    Please, let us exit this place.”

==

--

	You leave with the Empress.
    The Emprate was left in ruins
    but you find there were many places that were untouched.
    Only the capitals were partly destroyed
    and the Senatorial Province obliterated.


==

--

    And thus the people saw the Empress
    and her new heir and they said,
    “Let us make her our Supremess.”

==

--

    And so they took her to her province–The Third Imperial Province–
    and they made a new throne for her,
    one higher than all of the ones before it.
    And they made her a new crown, one greater than all of the ones before it,
    even greater than that of the Master Emperor.


==

--

	And ceremony was put forth
    and at the end they gave her title of Supremess
    and they gave her a new name so that her full title
    and name were The Supremess Caia Cornelia,
    the Supreme Empress over all of the people of Illyica.

==

--

	And therefore, she was seated on her throne and crowned.
    Then all the people shouted,
    “Every man is subservient to the Supremess!
    Every man is subservient to the Supremess!”
    As was their custom for their new rulers. For they believed:
	“All things must be ordered, all things must be delineated,
	all things must be subordinate.”

==

--

	And as she was now Supremess
    they discovered that the power that healed
    her made it so she would live for a thousand years
    and thus so she would reign for a thousand years.
