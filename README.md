# Imperial Defense

## Overview

This is an iOS game I made in 2018. It's similar to Space Invaders but with shielded soliders (like Halo) instead. The player's goal is to defeat each level, upgrade and at level 100 fight the final boss.

I made all the music, art, sound effects were generated, and programmed the whole thing.

It was released on the App Store and I think got around 80-100+ downloads.

## Reflections

This was one of my first major software projects (major to me at the time) and I learned quite a lot, especially in terms of production and my capabilites.
Making a game completely is just too much, and I was overly ambitious with the whole thing. Honestly I could have made a better game or many more games if I didn't focus so much on trying to make the game so long, which in the end didn't really pay off and no one cared about the length. In fact, I don't think many people even got that far.

Overall, the people who did play the game enjoyed it, I think the biggest problem in the design was the lack of mid-term goals, and the inherent limitations of the game format made it difficult to really be creative.
People would play for maybe 30-50 levels (difficulty was another issue as I made it too hard for some people) and then lose interest. My theory is that it got old and didn't really change up the pace with new mechanics.

Another issue was my lack of experience with optimization and software design at this point. I was very bad at design, and didn't understand OpenGL well enough to know how to use it properly.
This led to me write code and never want to change it as I was fearful to break it and therefore break the whole game. I also never really thought through the design, as I didn't really have any knowledge of how to do that effectively.
This all resulted in the game taking a lot of time to complete as I kept hitting performance issues or tangled code that I had a hard time solving.
Nevertheless, I doggedly worked through all those issues and did release it in the end. And some people did enjoy it, so it was worth it to a degree.
